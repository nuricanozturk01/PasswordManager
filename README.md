PasswordManager

Java FX Password Manager Project. In this project I use Mysql.

If you want to use this application, you have to change database informations, email informations in /util/Constant.java path. Also, MySQL script in /src/main/'MySQL Script' path.

This project have some dependencies that are in /PasswordManager/src/main/libs path. You should include these jar files in project.
